I need help building an end-to-end AI system for ingredient detection and recipe suggestions. Here's the detailed problem statement:

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Build a system that can:
1. Detect ingredients from food images
2. Generate personalized recipe suggestions based on detected ingredients
3. Consider dietary restrictions and preferences
4. Provide detailed cooking instructions

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. Image Processing & Ingredient Detection:
- Use a combination of YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN for accurate ingredient detection
- Implement image preprocessing for better detection accuracy
- Handle multiple ingredients in a single image
- Support real-time detection

2. Recipe Generation & Suggestions:
- Integrate with either Gemini AI or OpenAI's API for recipe generation
- Consider factors like:
  * Available ingredients
  * User's dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
  * Cooking skill level
  * Available cooking equipment
  * Time constraints
  * Nutritional requirements

3. System Architecture:
- Backend: Node.js/Express.js
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL for storing recipes and user preferences
- API Integration: RESTful endpoints for:
  * Image upload and processing
  * Recipe generation
  * User preferences management
  * Recipe storage and retrieval

4. Key Features:
- Real-time ingredient detection
- Recipe customization based on available ingredients
- Step-by-step cooking instructions
- Nutritional information
- Alternative ingredient suggestions
- Recipe scaling
- User feedback system
- Save favorite recipes
- Share recipes with others

5. User Experience:
- Clean, intuitive interface
- Mobile-responsive design
- Progress tracking
- Error handling and user feedback
- Loading states and animations

6. Additional Considerations:
- Handle edge cases (poor image quality, unknown ingredients)
- Implement caching for frequently used recipes
- Add rate limiting for API calls
- Ensure security for user data
- Optimize for performance

Please help me implement this system, starting with:
1. Setting up the project structure
2. Implementing the ingredient detection system
3. Integrating with AI for recipe generation
4. Building the user interface
5. Setting up the database schema
6. Implementing the API endpoints

Focus on creating a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly solution.
